Raincheck is a web based weather application that uses <a href="https://developer.forecast.io/"> The Dark Sky API</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro">The Google Maps Geocoding API</a> to allow weather search by city and zip.

This was a project I chose to create for my "No-Server" project at DevMountain. It's called the No-Server project because it is all front end with
no db's or servers.  I've wanted to make a weather app for sometime so I figure this would be a perfect opportunity.

Some challenges I ran into for this project was keeping all my "business-logic" in my service.  I wanted to keep my controllers as lightweight
as possible.
