A weather app that uses the dark sky api and google geocode to allow weather search by city/zip

This was a project I chose to create for my "No-Server" project at DevMountain. It's called the No-Server because it is all front end with
no db's or servers.  I've wanted to make a weather app for sometime so I figure this would be a perfect oppurtunity.

Some challenges I ran into for this project was keeping all my "business-logic" in my service.  I wanted to keep my controllers as lightweight
as possible.
